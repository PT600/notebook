# Independent 
    Variable X, Y are independent if:
        P(X, Y) = P(X)P(Y)

# Uncorrelated
    Variable X, Y are uncorrelated if:
        E(X, Y) = E(X)E(Y) 
    and Cov(X, Y) = E(x, Y) - E(X)E(Y) = 0

# Independent => Uncorrelated
    E(X, Y) = ffP(X,Y)dxdy = ffP(X)P(Y)dxdy =fP(X)dxfP(Y)dy = E(X)E(Y)
